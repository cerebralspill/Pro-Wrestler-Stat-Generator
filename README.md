# Pro-Wrestler-Stat-Generator
This is a personal project conceived and started during bootcamp!

This is a command line interface program that uses File I/O for file saving.

This is for the purpose of creating a set of wrestler stats in Pro Wrestling (think WWE), based on the method where a player roles 4 six sided dice, takes the highest three values and adds them together to create one stat value. This is repeated six times to get six values for each of the wrestler stats in WWE.

Once generated this program allows a user to sort their rolled numbers in either ascending or descending order. After sorting the user is prompted to place each rolled value into a statistic. If the user wants to swap a new number into an already allocated stat, they will be allowed to do so and the swapped number will be returned to the un-allocated pool.

Once all stats are allocated, the user can choose to name their wrestler and save the information to a text file.
